CodeWars Katas I`ve solved (Description + Solution)

## Folder Logic
All Katas are separated in folders by language and sub-folders by rank(kyu). E.g. /PHP/8kyu/\s\s
All Katas are indexed in [kata_index.md](kata_index.md).

## Organization
+ *Best Practice* Katas are prefixed by *bp_*.
+ *Minified* Katas are prefixed by *min_*.
+ *Minified Best Practice* Katas are prefixed by *min_bp_*.
Minified Katas can be either best practice or not, and the best practice Katas aren\`t minified (They still may have comments explaining the code and spaces for a better reading).\s\s
Some Katas may have only min_ or bp_ copies or none of them.\s\s
