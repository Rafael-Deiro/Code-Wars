CodeWars Katas I`ve solved (Description + Solution)

## Folder Logic
All Katas are separated in folders by language and sub-folders by rank(kyu). E.g. */PHP/8kyu/*<br>
All Katas are indexed in **Summary** section.

## Organization
+ **Best Practice** Katas are prefixed by ***bp_***.
+ **Minified** Katas are prefixed by ***min_***.
+ **Minified Best Practice** Katas are prefixed by ***min_bp_***.
Minified Katas can be either best practice or not, and the best practice Katas aren\`t minified (They still may have comments explaining the code and spaces for a better reading).<br>
Some Katas may have only min_ or bp_ copies or none of them.<br>

## Summary
### Katas Index
+ [**PHP**](PHP/)
    + [**8 kyu**](PHP/8kyu/)
        + [**Logs**](PHP/8kyu/logs/)
            - [*Summation Logs*](PHP/8kyu/summation.log.txt "summation.log.txt")
        - [*Summation*](PHP/8kyu/summation.php "summation.php")
